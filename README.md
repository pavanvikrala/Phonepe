# Phonepe
This Phonepe pulse is a project which helps us to visualize the extracted data on plotly dashboard. 
This project has been divided into 8 modules and 1 main.py. 
PhonePe Pulse is a data-driven insights platform developed by PhonePe, a digital payments platform in India. 
PhonePe Pulse provides real-time data and analysis on various aspects of digital payments, including transaction trends, consumer behavior, and merchant insights.
In this project. After importing all the required modules, I used Plotly one of the best data visualizaition libraries and plotted choropleth map to show the total transaction count and total transaction amount of all the states in a country. 
I also used other chats like Horizontal bar chart, pie chart, scatter plots etc to view the data states wise depending on the scenarios.
Finally I have also made visually appealing visualizations to show the top ten states/districts where the most transactions happened.
